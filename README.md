# Matter.js-Landing-Page
A clone of http://p--m.co/ using matter.js instead for the physics engine.


To do:
  1. Replace filler objects being spawn in individually with composite stacks, reducing the amount of code significantly.
  2. Add sprite to objects that redirect onclick to let users know they'll be redirected to another site
  3. Figure out why redirecting to another tab causes objects to spaz out and a bunch of new tabs open when going back to the        original site. For now, the current tab is replaced with the link URL.
  4. Other stuff
